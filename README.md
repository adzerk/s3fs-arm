# s3fs for `arm`

Built from https://github.com/[maresb/docker-build-s3fs](https://github.com/maresb/docker-build-s3fs).

They provide a downloadable `.deb` binary for `s3fs` [here](https://github.com/maresb/docker-build-s3fs#download). However, it is only available for `amd` - Hence this repository, that leverages their docker image to publish an `arm` `s3fs` binary.
